# Step 2: Invitation & Onboarding

Invitations matter. The way a person is invited into a space, a process or a software tool determines how they behave in or with it. The importance of clear invitations and onboarding is not to be underestimated, because these initial behaviors set an important precedent for all future behaviors and the culture of their group.

## Designing the onboarding experience

From the moment a new member of your DAO is invited into your collaborative budgeting process, to their onboarding and first steps in Alchemy, it is important that you think about what experience you would like the members to have and which behaviors you want to support.  

This is even more important in the current world of Dapps, where anyone who knows how to use Web 3.0 can theoretically join in and potential participants may arrive on your Alchemy page without having had any previous contact with your team. Dapp onboarding also has a lot of technical hurdles, which can be very intimidating to newbies.

## Onboarding toolkit

There are some key elements you may want to include in your onboarding toolkit for new users. Here is a list with links to examples from the Genesis Alpha DAO:

* [ ] Template for proposals \| [see example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBSIO0tOf1CcfzsyO7dlQd_LiYsV3sKPSQXmCkvibhU/edit)
* [ ] Onboarding video for new members \| [see example ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BucC_e7T2oo&t=331s)
* [ ] A technical FAQ \| [see example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1erC1TVPPul3V_RmhKbyuFrpFikyOX0LnDfWOqO20Q/edit)
* [ ] Links to examples of successful proposals
* [ ] Communication channel or group dedicated to onboarding
{% endhint %}

### Questions that can help you design your onboarding experience:

* Who would you like to participate in your DAO? Only those who understand how Dapps work, or do you want to be welcoming to Crypto-Newbies? Are there specific market segments you would like to reach? Even if your target audience is very crypto-savvy, be aware that basic onboarding is always needed. No matter how much expertise your users may have, being clear about the steps for joining is important and will have a big impact on the level and quality of engagement you can achieve.
* How easy should it be to participate?
