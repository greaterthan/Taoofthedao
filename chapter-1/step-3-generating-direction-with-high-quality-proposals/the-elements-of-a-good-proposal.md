# The elements of a good proposal

Making a strong proposal needs to strike a good balance between being short and to the point, but include all key information and background for others to make an informed decision on it. You donâ€™t want those reading it to feel overwhelmed, nor as if you were too lazy to give them a clear explanation of your pitch.
